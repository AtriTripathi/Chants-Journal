    <string name="help_text">A mantra consists of uniquely selected special syllables.\n\nEach mantra carries a
        certain amount of positive vibration, which when repeated regularly over a period of time can generate positive
        emotions, peace of mind and bestow oneself with sound health.\n\n This app allows you to add
        your personal list of mantras, with each Mantra having a definite amount of chants/goal to be
        completed. It also allows you to keep a track of the chants/malas completed.</string>

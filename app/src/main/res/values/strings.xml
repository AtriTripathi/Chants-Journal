    <string name="help_text">A mantra consists of uniquely selected special syllables.\n\nEach mantra carries a
        certain amount of positive vibration, which when repeated regularly over a period of time can generate positive
        emotions, peace of mind and bestow oneself with sound health.\n\n This app allows you to add
        your personal list of mantras, with each Mantra having a definite amount of chants/goal to be
        completed. It also allows you to keep a track of the chants/malas completed.

    <string name="mantra_note">A <b>Mala</b> is a sacred rosary in the form of a garland used for
        keeping count while reciting, chanting, or mentally repeating a mantra or the name
        of a deity. This <b><i>sādhanā</i></b> (practice) is known in Sanskrit as <b>Japa</b>. Malas are typically
        made with 18, 27, 54 or 108 beads.\n\nAccording to <i>Vedas</i> (Ancient India Text), the details of
        the recommended amount of Japa required for a Mantra in the current epoch is given below.\n \n
        <b>⦿ Chants</b> - 1,25,000\n
        <b>⦿ Hawan</b> - 12,500 \n
        <b>⦿ Tarpan</b> - 1,250\n
        <b>⦿ Maarjan</b> - 125\n
        <b>⦿ Brahman Bhoj</b> - 13\n\nAs an alternative, instead of performing above activities,
        we can perform chants equivalent to the combined total of all the above amounts, which approximately
        turns out to be 1,38,888. And, in order to nullify the effect of any erroneous chants, it is
        recommended to add some buffer amount to the sum and make it a total of 1,50,000.\n\n

        Now, if we consider an ideal <b><i>Japa Mala</i></b> to consist of <b>108 beads</b>, we are required to complete a total of
        1,500 Malas in order to reach an ideal chanting goal for any Mantra.
